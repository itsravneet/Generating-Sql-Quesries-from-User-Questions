# Generating-Sql-Quesries-from-User-Questions

This is an NLP project in which, I have implemented a model that
predicts the SQL query by taking the user's question and database
schema details.

It is very useful for a non-technical person who wants to get useful
information from the database without having any knowledge in
SQL.

I have used WikiSQL datset for solving this problem and have achieved 0.60 Bleu Score
